Meeting Notes: Post-Meeting with CTO Azzam and CEO Husam.

Date: 24-03-2024

AI Integration Discussion:
CEO Husam emphasized the importance of enhancing the app with AI capabilities.
Discussed potential areas where AI can be integrated into the app and processes.

Code Collaboration and Setup:
Husam will share the app's codebase and gather our GitHub accounts for collaboration.
We are to create individual branches and set up a database mirroring the development server.
The first task is to ensure the app runs on a local server that mimics the development environment.
We will familiarize ourselves with the current framework and functionality before proceeding.

Development Environment Requirements:
Ensure installation of PHP, MySQL, and a suitable web server to run the application locally.
We are to send our Git accounts, create branches from the development server, and work independently on our tasks.

Software Development Process:
The product analysis is complete, and documentation has been created.
We will break down the requirements into smaller tasks for implementation.
The initial phase involves installing the code, ensuring its functionality, and starting with bug fixing to become familiar with the software.
In the next phase, we will develop new features.
The final phase involves writing more complex code and integrating all the components.

Task and Merge Management:
Understanding the process of code merging and validation is crucial.
Bug fixing is the first phase to acquaint ourselves with the softwareâ€™s components and fix existing issues.
Following bug fixing, we move to feature development and more complex coding.
The methodology involves breaking down larger tasks into smaller, manageable pieces for implementation and testing.

Methodology:
Azzam shared his experience in systems development, starting with languages like C.
Emphasized the importance of starting with the basics, understanding core functions, and gradually advancing to complex features.

Next Steps:
Await the sharing of the codebase and GitHub account collection.
Set up our individual development environments.
Start working on assigned tasks as per the outlined development phases.
